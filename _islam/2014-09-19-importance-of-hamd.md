Shukur (thankfulness) is "reciprocating orally, in action or with the heart when a fortune comes and also to show respect to the owner."

Hamd, is done when gaining a fortune as well as a misfortune. It is commanded for mankind not to forget what Allah {% include snippets/swt.html %} has given to them, to reciprocate with Hamd and Shukur. It is said in the <a href="http://quran.com/2/152" target="_blank">Surah Al-Bakara, Ayah 152</a>:

> So remember Me; I will remember you. And be grateful to Me and do not deny Me.

As our Prophet {% include snippets/saws.html %} prayed all night long until his feet got swollen, Hazrat Aisha {% include snippets/ra.html %} asking him:

> O' messenger of Allah, your past and future sins have been forgiven, why are you doing this?

And our Prophet {% include snippets/saws.html %} replied:

> Should not I be a grateful slave?

In a Hadith it is said:

> Any important job that isn't started with praise (Hamd) to Allah {% include snippets/swt.html %} (by saying Alhamdulillah) will not be blessed (or plentiful).

There are many verses of the Quran and Hadith that inform the importance of Hamd and thanksgiving (Shukur), what can be gained from it, the wickedness of being ungrateful and its punishments.

It is said in the Surah of <a href="http://quran.com/14/7" target="_blank">Ibrahim, Ayah 7</a>:

> And [remember] when your Lord proclaimed, 'If you are grateful, I will surely increase you [in favor]; but if you deny, indeed, My punishment is severe.'
