There are six articles of faith in Islam:

1. Belief in Allah {% include snippets/swt.html %}.
2. Belief in the Books (scriptures).
3. Belief in Angels.
4. Belief in the Prophets of Allah.
5. Belief in the Day of Judgement.
6. Belief in the Divine Laws, namely that both good and evil are from Allah.

Umar Ibn Khattab {% include snippets/ra.html %} relates:

> We were sitting in the company of the Holy Prophet {% include snippets/saws.html %}, when suddenly a man arrived.

> He was wearing clean, white clothes and his hair was jet black.

> He did not look as though he was a traveller and he was not known to any of us.

> He sat down close to the Holy Prophet {% include snippets/saws.html %}, his knees touching the knees of the Holy Prophet {% include snippets/saws.html %}.

> He said:

>> O' Muhammad, tell me something about faith.

> The Holy Prophet {% include snippets/saws.html %} replied:

>> Faith is that you should believe in Allah, His Angels, His Books and His Prophets; that you should believe in the Day of Judgement and that you should believe in the Divine Laws relating to good and evil.

Ali ibn Talib {% include snippets/ra.html %} relates that the Holy Prophet {% include snippets/saws.html %} said:

> The faith is that a person recognises Allah at heart, accepts Him verbally and acts on His commandments.

> -- <cite>Ibn Majah</cite>

One who does not accept any of the above mentioned articles of faith is regarded as having denied them all.
