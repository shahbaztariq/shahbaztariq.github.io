The second requirement of Islam is Salah. After having true faith in Allah {% include snippets/swt.html %}, the Most High, and the Messenger Muhammad {% include snippets/saws.html %}, the most important pillar of Islam is Prayer (Salah). Salah is the sign of faith (al-Iman). There are forms of prayer in all the divine religions.

4. Facing the direction of the Qiblah (Istiqbal al-Qiblah).
5. Time (al-Waqt).
6. Intention (al-Niyyah).

### Acts of Salah ###

2. Standing (al-Qiyam).
3. Recitation (al-Qira'ah).
