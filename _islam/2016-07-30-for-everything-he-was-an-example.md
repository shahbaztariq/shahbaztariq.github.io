Hazrat Abu-Darda {% include snippets/ra.html %} narrated Once the Prophet {% include snippets/saws.html %} delivered a short Khutbah (sermon). When he's finished with his Khutbah he said:

> Stand up, O Abu Bakr! Deliver a Khutbah as well.

Abu Bakr {% include snippets/ra.html %} stood up and delivered a shorter Khutbah than our Prophet {% include snippets/saws.html %}. After that. the Prophet {% include snippets/saws.html %} said:

> Stand up, O Umar! Deliver a Khutbah as well.

Umar {% include snippets/ra.html %} stood up and delivered a short Khutbah than Abu Bakr. The Prophet {% include snippets/saws.html %} said stand up to so and so! Deliver a Khutbah as well! He was unable to beautify his words. After He {% include snippets/saws.html %} told him to "Sit", He {% include snippets/saws.html %} then said:

> Stand up, O Ummu (the mother of) Abd's son (Abdullah bin Masud). Deliver a Khutbah as well.

Abdullah bin Masud stood up and after praising Allah said: 

> O my people! Certainly Allah is our Lord, Islam is our religion, the Qu'ran is our guide, the House of Allah is our Kibla, (whilst indicating to the Prophet {% include snippets/saws.html %}) this noble person is our Prophet {% include snippets/saws.html %}. Whatever pleases Allah and His Messenger also pleases us. Whatever does not please Allah and His Messenger also does not please us. Peace be upon you.

The Prophet {% include snippets/saws.html %} then said:

> Ibn Masud got it right and spoke correctly. Whatever pleases Allah, my community and Ibn Masud also pleases me. Whatever does not please Allah, my community and Ibn Masud, does not please me.
